The novel's original title, which translates to English as \"The High Song\", does indeed refer to the Song of Solomon, which is often described in German as \"Das Hohe Lied der Liebe\". However, that is not the only possible inference. \"HoheLied\" has been translated as \"ode\" \"hosannas\" \"praises\" and used in purely secular as well as religious contexts. Most telling in this case is the use in German of the entire phrase to describe the \"great song of love\" or \"ode to love\" in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians.

First appearing in the 1883 novel Peck's Bad Boy and His Pa, the Bad Boy has appeared in numerous print, stage, and film adaptations. The character is portrayed as a mischievous prankster, and the phrase \"Peck's bad boy\" has entered the language to refer to anyone whose mischievous or bad behavior leads to annoyance or embarrassment. Described as \"a vicious little swaggerer\" and \"no more than a callous brute\", Hennery's antics were more mean-spirited than those of earlier boyhood characters like Huckleberry Finn, and modern criticism views the violence and racism in the original stories as objectionable or politically incorrect. The inspiration for Hennery—the Bad Boy—came from Edward James Watson, who was a telegraph messenger boy that Peck met in the early 1880s. Apparently Watson thought up many of the stories used by Peck. Mr Watson had in his possession a letter from Peck \"To my friend E. J.
